## Why did I leak this
I accidentally gave it to a bad person (cough cough Rinn) and he tried to get people to make a constant dumper for it so I decided a way to say "Fuck you!" because this build is <br/>right before I start to implement constant encryption

## Is this skidded?
It depends on what you think skidding is, for an example if it's on stackoverflow or a lua wiki I probably did. But I don't care it's private anyways.
